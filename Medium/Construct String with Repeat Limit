Description:
You are given a string s and an integer repeatLimit. Construct a new string repeatLimitedString using the characters of s such that no letter appears more than repeatLimit times in a row. You do not have to use all characters from s.

Return the lexicographically largest repeatLimitedString possible.

A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. If the first min(a.length, b.length) characters do not differ, then the longer string is the lexicographically larger one.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "cczazcc", repeatLimit = 3
Output: "zzcccac"
Explanation: We use all of the characters from s to construct the repeatLimitedString "zzcccac".
The letter 'a' appears at most 1 time in a row.
The letter 'c' appears at most 3 times in a row.
The letter 'z' appears at most 2 times in a row.
Hence, no letter appears more than repeatLimit times in a row and the string is a valid repeatLimitedString.
The string is the lexicographically largest repeatLimitedString possible so we return "zzcccac".
Note that the string "zzcccca" is lexicographically larger but the letter 'c' appears more than 3 times in a row, so it is not a valid repeatLimitedString.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aababab", repeatLimit = 2
Output: "bbabaa"
Explanation: We use only some of the characters from s to construct the repeatLimitedString "bbabaa". 
The letter 'a' appears at most 2 times in a row.
The letter 'b' appears at most 2 times in a row.
Hence, no letter appears more than repeatLimit times in a row and the string is a valid repeatLimitedString.
The string is the lexicographically largest repeatLimitedString possible so we return "bbabaa".
Note that the string "bbabaaa" is lexicographically larger but the letter 'a' appears more than 2 times in a row, so it is not a valid repeatLimitedString.
 

Constraints:

1 <= repeatLimit <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.
Python3:
from collections import Counter
import heapq

class Solution:
    def repeatLimitedString(self, s: str, repeatLimit: int) -> str:
        # Step 1: Count frequency of each character
        freq = Counter(s)
        
        # Step 2: Use a max-heap for lexicographically largest ordering
        # Python's heapq is a min-heap, so we store negative ASCII values to simulate a max-heap
        max_heap = [(-ord(char), char, count) for char, count in freq.items()]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)
        
        result = []
        
        while max_heap:
            # Step 3: Get the most frequent character with the highest lexicographical order
            _, char, count = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            
            # Step 4: Append the character up to `repeatLimit` times
            use_count = min(count, repeatLimit)
            result.append(char * use_count)
            count -= use_count
            
            # Step 5: Check if the character is exhausted
            if count > 0:
                # Step 6: Need a fallback character to avoid exceeding `repeatLimit`
                if max_heap:
                    # Get the next lexicographically largest character
                    _, next_char, next_count = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
                    result.append(next_char)  # Add it once to break the repeat limit
                    next_count -= 1
                    
                    # Push back the next character if there's still some remaining
                    if next_count > 0:
                        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-ord(next_char), next_char, next_count))
                    
                    # Push back the original character with remaining count
                    heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-ord(char), char, count))
                else:
                    # If no fallback character, we're done
                    break
        
        return ''.join(result)
