Description:
Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of 
set bits
 in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

Example 2:

Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

Example 3:

Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.

 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1
Python3:
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            # Increment count for each set bit
            count += n & 1
            # Right shift to process the next bit
            n >>= 1
        return count
